# 🌎 Hello World!

<!-- 
# 📜 The Lunes Manifest!



## 😊 Who we are

```
Lunes is a token-driven blockchain platform open to everyone
```

## 🔭 Our vision

```
- Be a simple, modular and expandable blockchain for everyone.
We believe that the simple fact of knowing how things work is the empowerment needed to build the impossible.
```
## 🚀 How did we get there

```
- Stabilizing the components through well-accurate documentation that is readable to all.
Blockchain solutions have become exoteric and unreadable, as technical debt overshadows
the entry of new minds and ideas.
```

## 🏗 What are we building

```
- Decoupling components and creating integrations for the current state of the platform.
We are building the SDK to facilitate the integration of new solutions with our blockchain.
Along with the sdk we are writing our documentation
All usage feedback from SDK and Docs is used to decouple the full-node to make it modular and expandable.
```
